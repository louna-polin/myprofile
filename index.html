						<h2>Travel</h2>
						<p>
							I love to travel. From a young age, I had the chance to discover many new horizons and today, the diversity of our region and its cultures fascinates me. Even when I feel like I know all the facets of a country, there is always a new place or a new element that comes to prove me wrong. <strong>That’s what I love, the infinity of landscapes and ways of living or thinking that exist. </strong>I would love to be able to say that I had the chance to see at least a part of every country in the world, and I will do everything to be able to say it.However, I rarely play soccer with my friends.

						<h2>Photography</h2>
						<p>
							Photography has always been a way for me to capture a moment and keep it alive. Despite the fact that the photos are not alive, they allow us to remember that this moment existed and sometimes even to mark the stop on a moment that we may not have noticed ourselves. My favorite type of photos are those that focus on everyday moments, taking pictures of passers-by in the street, or a corner of the street that we found cute when passing by, seeing people dancing in the middle of a party or making a smile when the photographer arrives and shouts « smile! ». It is often the unexpected moments that stand out the best and the photo comes out even more sincere.

						<h2>Fashion</h2>
						<p>
							Fashion is, in my opinion, a way of expressing ourselves without any limits. Indeed the diversity of possibilities and the multitasking of options or inspirations that exist allows each of us to find his account. The only thing that could prevent us from dressing as we wish is the gaze of others. Once this barrier is passed, fashion becomes our everyday bestfriend whether we decide to dress more « basic » or not. It evolves with us and changes with our age. So we might as well take advantage of our current desire and bring it to life at 100% instead of depriving ourselves of it!
